## Experience

**Senior Software Engineer - Square, Inc.**

_May 2018 - Present_

> I work on the Square Online Checkout team (SOC), helping sellers quickly enable online sales.

**Software Engineer - Weebly, Inc.**

_October 2017 - May 2018_

> In May 2018 Weebly was acquired by Square, Inc. My work bellow continued for the beginning of my career at Square.

> My work on the growth team consists of designing, building, and deploying software to more accurately measure the success of ad campaigns, landing pages, and A/B tests. This includes the design of APIs that allow for internal teams to easily consume this information. I created a tracking library to offload tracking work from the landing pages in order to improve TTI which in turn increased conversion rates. In architecting the library, I met with teams from all areas of our product to create a system which would address the tracking and data analytics needs of every stakeholder.

**Teaching Assistant - UW Information School**

_September 2016 - June 2017_

> As a teaching assistant for both the Server Side and Client Side Web Dev courses I ran mini-lectures and study groups to ensure every student was able to improve their own software engineering ability in a fun and engaging environment. I taught a range of tools including React JS, Golang,  and NodeJS and instructed the students in utilizing these tools to complete several projects throughout the quarter.

**Director of IT - IUGA**

_September 2016 - June 2017_

> As Director of IT for the Informatics Undergraduate Association (IUGA), I redesigned the IUGA website. The website featured a new officer election page that shuffled the order of the  candidates  upon each viewing, giving everyone the same chance to be at the top of the list. I also developed a build and release system for the website which is still used today.

**Software Engineer Intern - Weebly**

_June 2016 - September 2016_

> I worked on the Billing Team to create and maintain the checkout system at Weebly. We build elegant yet simple checkout flows for new Weebly products and services. We ensured translation and currency conversion worked seamlessly from initial pageview through purchasing a Weebly service.
